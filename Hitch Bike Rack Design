# Introduction
This design is a 2 bike hitch rack that can carry up to 100lbs. we chose this type of rack because we wanted to create an affordable (most hitch racks can reach up to $200) and reliable component.  
Hitch rack designs can carry bikes and can be adapted to carry skis, snowboards, cargo holders.
